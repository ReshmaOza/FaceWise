This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

# UI Design Explanation

You are a famous hacker who has access to a list of the world's most famous celebrities.
You have to create a system where you can view and edit their details to hide their public presence.

Your mission if you choose to accept it, you have to:

1. Create the user interface provided with the design provided

2. The page should have a search bar to search the list by celebrity name.

3. The user list item is an accordion,

   - when clicked on, it will cause all the other accordions to collapse and enlarge the one which was clicked.
   - If clicked on the same one it will collapse.
   - Manage the + and - icons in open or collapsed mode (collapsed = - | open = +)

4. Fetch the JSON file provided to fill the list of users. (NOTE - YOU CANNOT EDIT THE JSON FILE)

   - You have to calculate the age of the user based on the date of birth provided
   - gender should be a dropdown (Male | Female | Transgender | Rather not say | Other)
   - country is a text field
   - Description is a text area

5. Provide buttons to edit or delete

   - edit mode will let you edit the details of the user in the exact place
   - you can only edit the user if the user is an adult
   - validations to be implemented where a user cannot
     -- input text in the age field
     -- input numbers in the nationality
     -- keep anything empty
   - when in edit mode you can either save or cancel
     -- save button will be disabled by default and will enable only if the details have changed
     -- save click will update the user's details
     -- cancel will revert the details to their last known state
     -- you cannot open another accordion while in edit mode
   - delete mode should alert you if you actually want to delete the user
     -- if yes - the user will be deleted
     -- if no - do nothing

6. Typescript is a plus
